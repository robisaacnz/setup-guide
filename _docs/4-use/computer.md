Never let anyone else use your computer while it is signed in as you. Not even for a moment.

Always switch to the Guest user account using the menu bar icon before letting go of the keyboard.

This rule applies even to people you trust. If you trust them, so do we, but we don't trust the people who might attack them or trick them into compromising your computer.

If you regularly share your computer with someone you trust, create them their own account.
