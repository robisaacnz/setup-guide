We use [1Password for Teams](https://1password.com/teams/) to manage our logins and services. You'll need to install 1Password on your phone and your computer.

### On your phone
To install 1Password on your phone, use the [mobile applications]() install page later in this guide.

### On your computer
[Install 1Password](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/1password-password-manager-and-secure-wallet/id443987910?mt=12) from the Mac App Store.

Use your own [Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/apple-id) for this installation. Your personal Apple ID is the account you typically use for iTunes, iCloud, and other Apple services.

> The Slack app is free to install, and we pay for your use of the service.

If you don't have one, you should [create an Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203993) using your personal email address, not your work address.

If you're not sure if you have an Apple ID or you're not sure how to access it, you should [recover your Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/en-nz/HT201354) before continuing.
