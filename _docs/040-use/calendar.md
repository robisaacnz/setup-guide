[move to configure section] Figure.NZ uses a combination of [Google Calendar]() and [Meekan]() to manage appointments.

We provide a Google calendar account for you to use, and you should add it to the Calendar app on your computer. You can add it to your phone as well if you like.

[move to access section] If you're ever away from your computer and phone, you can also access it calendar by signing into your  [web calendar](https://calendar.figure.nz) with your Figure.NZ account.


Your work calendar can be used to schedule meetings or anything else you like.

Change the colour: Make the events calendar a different colour so you don't accidentally edit or delete things. 
Turn it off: You can leave it turned off if you want to: create an event in your own calendar and then change the colour swatch.

We'd also like you to block out any time when you want to concentrate or don't want to be disturbed.

## Personal schedule
You can keep track of your personal appointments in any calendar system you prefer. You can keep them in your work account, create a separate personal calendar, use a personal iCloud or Gmail account, or a mix of all of these.
We encourage you to do this so our scheduling tools don't create conflicts with your personal life. If you don't have a good personal calendar set up already, we're happy to help.

When you stop working for Figure.NZ, we will remove your access to your work calendar, so please consider this before using your work calendar for personal appointments.

## Events
The _Events_ calendar tells you every morning about any big events happening that day.
Anyone can add an item to the _Events_ calendar.
You can also subscribe to Events in other calendar tools, to help you with your own scheduling.

> The Events calendar is only for recording important things and announcing them on Slack. It's not a real person and can't be invited to meetings.

## Holidays
The _Holidays_ calendar will automatically tell you about any public holidays happening in the next week. It will also remind you on the day.

## Meekan
We use [Meekan](https://meekan.com) to schedule meetings.

## Privacy
Our systems never give your coworkers access to your personal calendar. If anyone asks to see your personal calendar, report this on Slack immediately.

## Setting up your work calendar
Log in to [your calendar](https://calendar.figure.nz).
Change your sharing settings to something that works.

## Setting up Meekan
In Slack, type:

**/msg @meekan connect me**

Follow the link and add your work calendar and any personal calendars that show times when you are busy.
You can change these settings at any time by typing:

**/msg @meekan settings**

## Booking a meeting

**/msg @meekan book lunch with @whereishayden next monday**

**/msg @meekan book a meeting called Catch Up with @lilliangrace tomorrow afternoon**

Don't use specific times unless the other attendees have already agreed to it. Using "morning" or "afternoon" allows Meekan some flexibility to find a match that works for everyone, which in turn means your meeting is less likely to be declined.

There's a guide to all [Meekan commands](https://meekan.com/slackhelp).

No one keeps their calendar 100% up to date all the time. Don't assume that a time Meekan thinks is good will automatically be accepted by every attendee.

If your coworker has shared their work calendar with you, don't assume you can book the gaps. Only Meekan can schedule these safely.

We also support your personal calendars stored in Google accounts, Microsoft accounts or Apple's iCloud.
If you have personal calendars as well, we'll never access events, but we will try to avoid scheduling meetings at times that conflict with your personal appointments.
