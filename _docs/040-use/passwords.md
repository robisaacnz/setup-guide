## Passwords to remember
You need to remember two passwords:

* Your login password, which unlocks your computer.
* Your passphrase, which unlocks your 1Password vaults.

## Passwords to forget
You need to forget all your other passwords, even for trivial personal services like Netflix. Any password you can remember is a bad password, and exploits through your weakly secured personal accounts put our systems at risk as well.

## Password rules
There are only two rules:

* **Never** write your passwords down or store them anywhere in your computer or phone other than 1Password.
* **Never** share anything from 1Password with any other person, including other staff, even if they ask or you think it would be really helpful.

There are no complicated requirements to change your passwords every week or anything else like that. Instead, we do a quick audit once a month.

## Password audit
About once a month, this Slack reminder will appear:

> Slack reminder text or screenshot goes here.

When you see this message, follow these steps:

1. Open 1Password on your computer and unlock it by typing your passphrase.
2. Make sure *Show Item Counts* is turned on in the View menu.
3. Under Security Audit at the bottom left, click any categories that have a number next to them, and fix the issues listed.
4. Once there are no numbers next to the *Watchtower*, *Weak Passwords*, and *Duplicate Passwords* categories under Security Audit, [take a screenshot]() and post it to a Slack thread in reply to the reminder message.

#### Notes:

* Don't worry about the *6-12 months old* and the *1-3 years old* categories. It's normal for there to be items in those.
* If there's an issue with a shared service that we provide, mention it on Slack and we'll fix it for you.
* If you have any items in the *3+ years old* category, please find and change these passwords before next month.
* If you don't respond to the Slack message within 24 hours, your access will be restricted. Just post a screenshot to restore it.
