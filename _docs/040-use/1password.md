1Password for Teams only shows you the passwords for your team, plus some shared logins that everyone is likely to need.

Team passwords are segregated this way to reduce the loss from any one person being compromised. We trust you, but we don't trust the people who have stolen your computer.

If you can't see a password for something you need, it may be because you're not a member of that team. Our 1Password for Teams setup mirrors our [team organisation](http://tohu.figure.nz/internal/working_together/#how-we-are-organised) and Slack setup, 

 Ask in #general if anyone else can see a login for the service you're trying to access. If they can, ask an admin to check 

If anyone else who works here asks you for a password (or a credit card), don't give it to them! Tell them to get it from 1Password instead. Impersonating employees is the #1 way to escalate an attack, so get into the habit of being gentle but firm.
