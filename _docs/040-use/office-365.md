We don't use Microsoft Office internally, but you can use it to communicate contracts and documents with third parties, or privately for your own use. We encourage you to use whatever software tools you feel comfortable with to do your work, but we prefer that our shared information is not held in proprietary formats that require a fee to access.

If you need an Office 365 license, ask on Slack.

## Rules
We have two rules for using Microsoft Office:

1. *Never* use Office 365 to publish anything that will be seen by the general public, because it does not render our brand fonts correctly.
2. *Never* use Office 365 for documents you will share with other staff, because Office documents are a security risk and not everyone uses it or has it installed.

## Notes
If you've used Microsoft Office to create documents for your own use, convert them before sharing them with other team members. It's important to do this even if you believe the other team member uses Microsoft Office as well, to ensure your work remains accessible to everyone.

The best way to do this depends on your intention. Some common approaches:

* Word documents work best as Slack posts (if you don't require collaboration) or Google Docs (if you still need others to work or comment on your document). 
* The data team exports Excel workbooks as CSV files, which preserve the data while removing Microsoft-specific features.
* PowerPoint presentations can be delivered using Keynote, which addresses the font branding issue. Archived versions can be stored as PDF files in Google Drive.
* Finished versions of contracts and other legally binding records prepared with third parties can be stored in Google Drive as PDF files.
