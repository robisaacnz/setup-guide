### New rules

* You must install Apple updates as soon as they become available. 
* You must use FileVault disk encryption with a passphrase you do not use anywhere else.
* Your laptop must require a password to resume from a lid-close event.
* You must keep at least one current Time Machine backup, and these backups must be encrypted. We provide a free Time Machine target in the Auckland office. If you work entirely remotely, we'll arrange something else.
* You must install major OS upgrades within 180 days of their release.
