We use [1Password for Teams](https://1password.com/teams/) to manage access to our services.

You'll need to install 1Password on your phone and your computer.

### On your phone
To install 1Password on your phone, use the [mobile applications]() install page later in this guide.

### On your computer
[Install 1Password](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/1password-password-manager-and-secure-wallet/id443987910?mt=12) from the Mac App Store.

Use your own [Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/apple-id) for this installation. Your personal Apple ID is the account you typically use for iTunes, iCloud, and other Apple services.

> ðŸš© The 1Password app is free to install, and we pay for your use of the service.

If you don't have one, you should [create an Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203993) using your personal email address, not your work address.

If you're not sure if you have an Apple ID or you're not sure how to access it, you should [recover your Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/en-nz/HT201354) before continuing.

### Personal use
1Password for Teams includes support for your personal passwords, and we strongly encourage you to use this if you don't already have a password manager. The security of our whole organisation improves when everyone has good password management.

1Password for Teams never shares the contents of your personal vault with us or anyone else, and if you stop working here, we'll pay for an extra three months of service to give you time to retrieve your passwords.
