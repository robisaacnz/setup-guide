You'll need to install Google Drive on your phone and your computer.

### On your phone
To install Google Drive on your phone, use the [mobile applications](../../1-install/mobile/) install page later in this guide. Mobile applications are easier to get working when you already have their desktop versions, so we recommend you set up your computer first.
