We use the [git](https://git-scm.com) distributed version control system to manage our source code. This includes our software products and internal documentation.

We host all of our source code on [GitHub](https://github.com). GitHub provides a desktop application that simplifies using git.

You'll need to install GitHub Desktop on your computer.

### On your computer
Go to the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) web site.

> ðŸš© The GitHub Desktop app is free to install, and we pay for your use of the service.

Click the **Download for macOS** button.

### On your phone
We don't recommend you try to use GitHub from your phone. There are no official apps for doing this. There are some third party apps, but their use and configuration is beyond the scope of this guide.

If you intend to be away from your computer for a long time (for example, while travelling) and you need to access GitHub, please let us know.


### Next steps
[Install the mobile apps](../../1-install/mobile/), or [configure GitHub Desktop](../../2-configure/github/).
