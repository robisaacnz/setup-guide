We use [Slack](https://slack.com) for our internal communications. It's our most important application by far, and once you have access to Slack you can get help with anything else.

You'll need to install Slack on your phone and your computer.

### On your phone
To install Slack on your phone, use the [mobile applications]() install page later in this guide. Mobile applications are easier to get working when you already have their desktop versions, so we recommend you set up your computer first.

### On your computer
[Install Slack](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12) from the Mac App Store.

Use your own [Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/apple-id) for this installation. Your personal Apple ID is the account you typically use for iTunes, iCloud, and other Apple services.

> ðŸš© The Slack app is free to install, and we pay for your use of the service.

If you don't have one, you should [create an Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203993) using your personal email address, not your work address.

If you're not sure if you have an Apple ID or you're not sure how to access it, you should [recover your Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/en-nz/HT201354) before continuing.
